so we have our xml input, which is kind of weird this doc is just to try to
help you understand the tree traversal without having to worry about rust

essentially we are going to walk through the xml tree, and as we encounter new
nodes, we're going to add them to the bookmark tree

the part that gets rust specific is the references

do we create the Bookmark at the same level of the xmlNode before, during or after?

maybe as a first exercise, just do DFS, skip the unimportant nodes, and then print them
then we can find out what to do
